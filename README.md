# Page Pre-Rendering and Data Fetching with NextJS
 Pre-rendering Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: Static Generation and Server-side Rendering. The difference is in when it generates the HTML for a page.  Static Generation: The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request. Server-side Rendering: The HTML is generated on each request.  Data Fetching Data fetching in Next.js allows you to render your content in different ways, depending on your application's use case. These include pre-rendering with Server-side Rendering or Static Generation, and updating or creating content at runtime with Incremental Static Regeneration.
